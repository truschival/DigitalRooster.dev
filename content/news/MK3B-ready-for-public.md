summary: >
    I hesitated quite some time to place a new order with PCBway. The design was
    ready in May but component cost have gone way up since last November. Some
    parts cost more than double.
    But when my friend told me some of his friends are also interested in 
    DigitalRooster it was time to go ahead fast. PCBway was quick, I only 
    ordered 8 assemblies. Which in hindsight might have been an error, it looks
    they hand-soldered again instead of using a pick-and-place.
    DigitalRooster is ready for adventurous makers to use it and abuse it!

I am happy to see the there is interest in digitalrooster. I would not have
expected that. I tested the assemblies I keep for further development and sent
out the others to some friends for analysis. It seems there is no hardware bug
so far.

Now is the time to prepare how to produce a larger batch and sell it on
[tindie.com](https://www.tindie.com/products/21067/).  Turns out this raises
some burocratic issues. Most bothering are VAT, or Mehrwertsteuer as we call it
in Germany. When selling to a end customer it is pretty straight forward, I will
charge 19% German VAT and give the tax to the german government. If I sell to a
business the receive will pay the VAT. Unfortunately Tindie does not have the
option to state a price without VAT - the tindie-price incldudes VAT.

Fine for the private customer, confusing for the business customer, annoying for
me: Tindie charges 5% sales fee + 3-4% payment processing fee on the total price
including shipping. This means Tindie charges fee on taxes - not sure how I will
do the accounting for this. I will have to ask.

I also have no clear idea on packaging and shipping. Apparently Corona Virus
affects the postal service. DHL now does no longer ship "PÃ¤ckchen XS" i.e. small
packages to the US. This drives shipping costs beyond reasonable...
