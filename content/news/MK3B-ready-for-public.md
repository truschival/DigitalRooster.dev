summary: >
    I hesitated quite some time to place a new order with PCBway. The design was
    ready in May but component cost have gone way up since last November. Some
    parts cost more than double.
    But when my friend told me some of his friends are also interested in 
    DigitalRooster it was time to go ahead fast. PCBway was quick, I only 
    ordered 8 assemblies. Which in hindsight might have been an error, it looks
    they hand-soldered again instead of using a pick-and-place.
    DigitalRooster is ready for adventurous makers to use it and abuse it!

I am happy to see the there is interest in digitalrooster. I would not have
expected that. I tested the assemblies I keep for further development and sent
out the others to some friends for analysis. It seems there is no hardware bug
so far.

Now is the time to prepare how to produce a larger batch and sell it on
[tindie.com](https://www.tindie.com/products/21067/). I also have not yet an
idea on packaging.

Stay tuned.
