I made a range of changes and hopefully improvements to the PCB. Not only to the
layout but also to the schematics. I double checked my wiring and components,
replaced the 5US$ Maxim DS1388 real time clock with a cheaper TI BQ32000 for
2US$.

Replaced THT components with SMD and sent it to
[pcbway.com](https://www.pcbway.com) for quotation.  The BOM quotation is
absolutely fair priced! The price is comparable to digikey for small numbers. At
the moment they run discounts for assembly, for a five prototype PCBs they also
only charge 30$ setup costs - dirt cheap!

I gave it a placed the order yesterday - lets wait and see, ETA is 25 days.
So if all goes well I will get a nice Christmas present.
