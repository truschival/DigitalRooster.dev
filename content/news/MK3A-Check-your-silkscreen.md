description: "New PCBs - Chip orientation!"
summary: >
    Finally I received the assembly for the revised layout of my Audio PCB.
    Covid-19 has affected lead times but PCBway was quicker than estimated.
    Unfortunately not everything was working and it is not pcbway's fault.
    I learned you should not blindly trust the CAD data you get, even from
    ultralibrarian.

I have ordered a new batch of five prototypes of the latest revision of
Digitalrooster-Audio Mk3A. The idea was this would be the final prototype before
ordering a small batch to sell on [tindie.com](https://www.tindie.com/).  This
time pcbway assembled most parts manually. They claim they placed and soldered
the ICs on the machine but I have my doubts. It makes little sense to me to
create a stencil, program the pick-and-place, put 5 PCBs on a SMT line,mount
five chips each PCB, go through reflow and later hand-assemble the 40+ resistors
and capacitors.... But I am no expert on SMT production.  Anyway the super-cap
was inverted on the proving pictures they sent, I checked and asked for
correction, easy.

I missed the to check the orientation of U1, the LED driver TLC59208F, it was
turned 180Â°. This is not pcbway's fault. I also probably would not have caught
the error. Look at this silkscreen! See where the marking is? Clearly not next
to pin 1.

I got the TLC590208F CAD data from
[ultralibrarian.com](https://app.ultralibrarian.com/details/167ff272-103f-11e9-ab3a-0a3560a4cccc/Texas-Instruments/TLC59208FIRGYR?uid=83804a30ac595c47)
and didn't event think about the possibility that this could be an issue - I was
wrong.

Connecting the PCB to Raspberry Pi short-circuited the 3v3 rail and probably
killed the touch controller of one of my displays. But the bug was easy to find
the chip got really hot, I almost burnt my fingers.  Asking around among my
friends, nobody had a hot-air desolder station available.  The way to remove the
chip was using a common hot-air blower, wrapping the PCB in Aluminium foil. This
worked pretty well.  Soldering the chip was not that easy for my shaky hands and
big solder tip. I had three new chips left, two have been soldered successfully.

In the end I am happy finally I have backlight control PWM on a Banana Pi.  I
will fix the silkscreen and make some minor layout improvements in KiCad. Some
smaller points like matching the APDS9960 connector to match the
[Adafruit APDS 9960](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-apds9960-breakout)
breakout board and beautification.
