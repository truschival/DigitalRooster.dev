All hardware offered by DigitalRooster, especially the extension board is a
module without independent function, and is exclusively intended for development
or education purposes under laboratory conditions. They are not intended for
people who have no training and experience in the field. For use or operation
specialist knowledge and training is required. Please observe safety
instructions and regulations that apply in your country.

## General electronics precautions

I assume you are an expert and are knowledgeable in precautionary measures for
handling electronics and dealing with electrical circuits. Observe the rules and
guidelines you learned!

Just to remind you:
-  Short circuits can create heat and may lead to fire or injury. Make sure your
   assembly is clean and does not have unintended solder bridges!
-  Only use components within specifications!
-  Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) may damage or destroy your components and
   circuits
-  Electronic circuits may cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other
   devices. Take appropriate measures such as shielding. Don't operate the
   circuits next to sensitive devices e.g. medical equipment.
-  Unregulated power sources have voltage spikes and can cause damage to your
   equipment!
-  Capacitors and inductors store energy! Even if your circuit is disconnected,
   be careful, these components may still have charge that can damage your
   delicate components or hurt
-  Disconnecting an inductor during load causes the voltage to rise an may cause
   sparks
-  Soldering irons are hot and may cause injuries. Soldering fumes are
   hazardous, only solder in a well ventilated room or use an exhaust.
-  Electronic components, solder, solder flux, iso-propanol and other chemicals
   are poisonous and not to be ingested. Do not eat or drink while working with
   these substances!

## Environmental concerns and disposal

Electronics contain rare and hazardous materials. Even if your PCB is just a few
grams and the PCB only uses ROHS components it does not mean it is
bio-degradable! Electronic waste is a global problem, it contaminates
groundwater and the food chain. **Do not dispose printed circuit boards,
batteries, electronic components in household trash or unsorted municipal
landfills. Do not burn the electronics**. Please bring your waste to special
collection points, you can find them at retail stores or ask your local waste
disposal utility.

If you do not have the possibility to safely dispose the assembly you can send
the components purchased from digitalrooster.dev back with sufficient postage
