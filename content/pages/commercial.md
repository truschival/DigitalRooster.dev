## Where to buy

I decided to rather pay commision to
[tindie.com](https://www.tindie.com/products/21067/) and sell relatively
hassle-free than setting up my own web-shop.

### What is included?

The extesionboard, with all SMT parts plus:
-   3x 5mm terminal blocks for loud speakers
    (e.g. TE Connectivity 282836-2 or similar)

-   1x 6-pin-header 90Â°, 2.54mm (e.g. Adam Tech PH1RA-06-UA or similar)
    for the Greyhill rotary encoder with push-button.

## Complaints & Suggestions
